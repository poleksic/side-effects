% This is Algorithm 2 from Witten's paper 
% (Witten et al. BiostatisticsÂ 10, no. 3 (2009): 515-534.)
% X is nxp matrix 
% v is px1 vector
% u is nx1 vector
% reasonable is to use maxiter ~ 200 and precision ~ 1e-7

%     INPUT:
% C1 (reg on u) should range from 1 and sqrt(n)
% C1 (reg on v) should range from 1 and sqrt(p)

%     OUTPUT:
% columns of u are u_1, ..., u_k (each one is n-dimensional)
% columns of v are v_1, ..., v_k (each one is p-dimensional)
% columns of d are d_1, ..., d_k (each one is 1-dimensional)
